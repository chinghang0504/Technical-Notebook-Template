## 3.1 Typefaces
### Serif
![Serif](../resources/image_3_1.PNG)

- Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters.
- These details are known as serifs.

### Sans-Serif
![Sans-Serif](../resources/image_3_2.PNG)

- Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.

### Monospace
![Monospace](../resources/image_3_3.PNG)

- Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)

### Weigh
![Weigh](../resources/image_3_4.PNG)

- The font weight not only adds emphasis but can also affect the amount of white space and contrast on a page.

### Style
![Style](../resources/image_3_5.PNG)

- Italic fonts have a cursive aspect to some of the lettering.
- Oblique font styles take the normal style and put it on an angle.

### Stretch
![Stretch](../resources/image_3_6.PNG)

- In condensed (or narrow) versions of the font, letters are thinner and closer together.
- In expanded versions they are thicker and further apart.
