## 3.1 Long Quotations \<blockquote>
- A lengthy, block-level quotation
```html
<p>Renowned type designer, Matthew Carter, has this to say about his
profession:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in
    what a designer can do with the individual letters.</p>
    <p>Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written
    down. It's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each
    conductor interprets that score differently. There is tension in
    the interpretation.</p>
